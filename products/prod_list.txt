SAFEHAVENTECH PRODUCT LINK REPLACEMENT GUIDE

1. Find the <div class="product-card"> for each placeholder.
2. Replace the <img src="...placeholder..."> with your actual Amazon product image URL.
3. Update the <h3> title to the real product name.
4. Modify the <p> description to include key specs from the actual product.
5. Change the <a href="#" class="buy-button">Buy on Amazon</a> link:
   - Insert your Amazon affiliate URL in place of "#".
   - Ensure link has attributes: target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener".
6. (Optional) Add Amazon tracking sub-IDs: e.g. ?tag=yourtag-20&ascsubtag=section01â€“1.

Repeat for all 12 product cards.

Maintaining the existing `.product-card` structure ensures hover and click animations work seamlessly.
